      <p1> The HUMAN race has been increasingly overloading the atsmophere
          with carbon dioxide and this over time has created a blanket of
          heat. This is called a Carbon footprint and everyone has one.
          In addition, to everyone's carbon footprint this blaket is holding
          all the everyday green house gases from fossil fuels such as modern 
          day oils, fuel gas,and even something as simple as hair-spray.</p1>

       <div class="Boxed2">
      <p2> You may ask yourself how you could help the enviroment and make your
          carbon foot print smaller? First let's introduce the true definition
          of a carbon footprint. "The amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds
           emitted due to consumption of fossil fuels by an indiviual" is the full
          definition. For example, how much water you use, if you recycle, electircity
          used, the amount of waste you produce and transport is considered when 
          looking into your individual footprint.</p2>
      </div>
      <div class="Boxed3">
      <p3> Some easy solutions are to become more aware of how much of the enviroments
          resources you are using everyday. Heating & electricity conservation by only
          using what your need when you need it, using less water, eating less meat and 
          more organic foods, and driving less or switching to an Eco-friendly vehicle
          are great ways to start!</p3>
